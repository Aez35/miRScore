To test miRScore functionality and possible errors that might occur when released, three test datasets were created.

#Test 1 - Input file is not in fasta format
File:
Test1-NotFasta.txt
Test command:
python Final_miRScore.py --mature Test1-NotFasta.txt --hairpin precursors.fa --fastqd fastqs/

#Test 2 - Characters besides A, T, G, or C are present in the miRNA or hairpin.
FIle:
Test2-ATGC.fa
Test command:
python Final_miRScore.py --mature Test2-ATGC.fa --hairpin precursors.fa --fastqd fastqs/


#Test 3 - This tests two issues. The first is what happens if a miRNA candidates does not have a hairpin with a matching name.
#         The second issue is what if the miRNA maps to multiple locations on the corresponding hairpin.
File:
Test3_hairpin.fa
Test3_mir_mm_noHP.fa
Test command:
$ python Final_miRScore.py --mature Test3_mir_mm_noHP.fa --hairpin Test3_hairpin.fa --fastqd fastqs/
